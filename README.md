#### String Comparisons in Python to Evaluation Phonological Phenomena 

The objective of this project was to implement code in Python that can analyze two strings (of the same length or of differing lengths), and return a ruleset that explains the changes they underwent to go from string 1 â†’ string 2, where string 1 is the input and string 2 is the output. This type of analysis is something commonly done in the field of computational phonology through the use of logical languages like  first order logic and monadic second order logic.
