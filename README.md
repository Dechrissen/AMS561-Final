## Final Project for AMS 561 - Introduction to Computational Science
### Derek Andersen and Joanne Chau
#### First Order Logic in Python to Evaluation Phonological Phenomena 

In linguistics, it is theorized that every speakers' brain accepts and input and has constraints against how things are said (their output), which is why, often times, the input and output are different. In English, depending on the sound proceeding plural marker, its plural can be pronounced differently. For example, cat ends with a voiceless sound, and when pluralized, the s is also silent, but in the word dog, the g is voiced so even though in typology, we write it as a s, it's actually pronounced as a z. 

Implementing Levenshtein Distance to compare input and output strings, we hope our program can evaluate the differences between the input and output of strings to return the phonological processees the string underwent from the input to the output. We hope the advances we made on this project can be furthered by thorough research as we see this being an important topic for understanding human language in the Computational world.
