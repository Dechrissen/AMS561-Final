#### String Comparisons in Python to Evaluation Phonological Phenomena 

The objective of this project was to implement code in Python that can analyze two strings(of the same length or of differing lengths), and return a ruleset that explains the changesthey underwent to go from string 1â†’string 2, where string 1 is the input and string 2 isthe output.  This type of analysis is something commonly done in the field of computationalphonology  through  the  use  of  logical  languages  like  first  order  logic  and  monadic  secondorder logic.  Ideally, we would want to implement a method for the logical analysis of stringsin Python as well
